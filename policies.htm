<H1>Standard Course Policies</H1></CENTER>The following course policies are for 
the course sections taught by <B>Prof. John Wright</B>. 
<P>This policy page was updated&nbsp;<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Type="EDITED" S-Format="%m/%d/%y" startspan -->11/23/2021<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" i-checksum="13126" endspan -->. 
<BR>
&nbsp;<H2><U>Course Withdrawal:</U></H2>
You may withdraw from the course up to the deadline set by the Registrar's Office. &nbsp;Although not required, if you are thinking about withdrawing from the course, please come talk with me first as I may be able to help.
<H2><U>Attendance:</U></H2>
Unless specified as part of the course grade, attendance is your decision, but it <strong>will be noted</strong> during the semester and considered in certain circumstances (see grading below).&nbsp; 
Missing classes will negatively impact on class participation.&nbsp; <strong><em><u>Students</u></em></strong> are responsible for material covered during their 
absences.&nbsp;
<p>The responsibility for making up missed work, 
scheduling missed exams/quizzes, and covering missed material due to an excused 
absence lies<B><I> </I></B>with the<B><I> <U>student</U></I></B>.&nbsp; An 
excused absence, including illness, does <B>NOT</B> automatically provide an 
excuse for late assignments.&nbsp; Please alert me as soon as possible if you 
know you will need to miss a class.</p>
<H2><u>Late Assignments:</u></H2>
<p>If 
  accepted, late submissions may be penalized.&nbsp; Extensions without penalty are 
  more likely to be granted if the instructor is contacted with a reasonable 
  request prior to the due date.&nbsp; All requests for extensions will be logged 
  (as well as any other "exceptional" requests), and this information will be used 
  in determining the student's final grade. </p>
<p><strong>Late work will NOT be accepted if the assignment has already been graded 
  and returned or solutions have been discussed in class.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Late assignments will NOT be accepted after the last day of the semester.</strong></p>
<H2><U>In Class Conduct:</U></H2>
Students are expected to be attentive in 
class.&nbsp; In particular, they are expected to participate in the 
lecture/discussion, and <B><I><U>NOT</U></I></B> get lost in computer applications or on cell phones.&nbsp; A general rule of thumb to follow 
is to use technology in class in a professional manner.&nbsp; Use the technology for class work and avoid distractions to yourself and your classmates.&nbsp; Inappropriate use of technology in class will affect any class participation grade and in class conduct may be a component in 
determining the student's final grade. <BR>
<H2><U><FONT size=+2>Standard Grading Scale:</FONT></U></H2>
I&nbsp;assign grades according to the following 
table.&nbsp; For students on the border between grades, I <strong><em>might</em></strong> give them the "benefit of the doubt" after considering their class participation, attendance, and effort.

    <TD>D-&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>For students with a grade on the 
borderline, achieving benefit of the doubt will mean that you have demonstrated 
some tangible evidence that you have made an honest attempt to perform.&nbsp; 
Some examples include, but are not limited to:<ol>
  <li>Attending 
<B><I>and</I></B> participating in class (see <U>In Class Conduct</U> and 
<U>Attendance</U> above).</li>
  <li>Doing the suggested homework 
problems and asking questions if you are having trouble with them.</li>
  <li>Turning in all the assignments (on time) and asking 
questions if you are having trouble with them.</li>
  <li>Demonstrating that you have read the pertinent chapters and reviewed your 
  class notes.</li>
  <li><b>PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS.</b>&nbsp; <i>But</i>, when asking questions, ask 
  well-informed questions.&nbsp; Demonstrate that you have tried and have 
  thought about a solution or an answer.&nbsp; Use props or code printouts to 
  help me understand what you are asking and to show that you have tried to find 
  a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a student says they are "working really hard", but they miss class 
  frequently, miss assignments, or turn in assignments late, then their actions 
  are not consistent with their statement.&nbsp; I want to give the benefit of the 
  doubt to students who are working hard, but I can only judge effort by <strong><em>tangible evidence</em></strong>. </p><H2><U>Academic 
Integrity:</U></H2>
<p><u>General</u>: <a href="http://www.juniata.edu/academics/provost/integrity.php" target="_blank">http://www.juniata.edu/academics/provost/integrity.php</a> <br>
&ldquo;All members of the Juniata College community share  responsibility for establishing and  maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty  and integrity. Students oblige themselves to  follow these standards and to encourage others  to do so. Faculty members also have an obligation to comply with the principles and procedures of academic honesty and  integrity as listed here through personal  example and the learning environment they  create.<br><br>
  One of the strongest traditions in higher  education is the value the community places upon academic  honesty. Academic integrity is an assumption that  learning is taken seriously by students and  that the academic work that students do to be  evaluated is a direct result of the commitment of  the student toward learning as well as the personal knowledge gained.<br>
Academic dishonesty, therefore, is an attempt by a student to present knowledge in any aspect as personal when in fact it is knowledge gained by  others.&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong><em>All</em></strong> coursework is to be done<strong> individually </strong>unless otherwise noted on the assignment/test/project/etc.</p>
<p><B>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B> 
  <BR>
  The work you (and your partner(s), if applicable) turn in, should be your own 
  work. 
</p>
<P>Discussing <B><U>ideas</U></B> and working on <B><U>concepts</U></B> with 
other students (or groups, if applicable) for an assignment<I> <B>is 
encouraged</B></I>. 
<P>Sharing <B><U>solutions</U></B> or <B><U>code</U></B> with other students (or 
groups) <B><I>is strictly forbidden</I></B>.&nbsp; Using solutions from previous 
semesters is also forbidden. 
<BR><B>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B> 

<p>If you are struggling with an assignment, it is much better to ask me for help, even if it will be late, than turning in work that is not 
  your own. I report all cases of violation to the Provost's Office.</p>
<p> Students are expected to follow the official College policy on 
  Academic Honesty, as described in the <u>Pathfinder</u>. <br>
  Offenses <strong>include</strong>, but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>receiving an 
  inappropriate amount of help from someone else</li>
  <li>providing an inappropriate amount of help to someone else (i.e. showing/sharing programs, etc.)</li>
  <li>turning in work by someone else as your own</li>
  <li>working in groups larger than allowed</li>
  <li>using solutions from other or previous sections of the course</li>
  <li>cheating on an exam </li>
</ul>
<p>Plagiarism is possible in programming just as it is in writing. &nbsp;Do your own work and cite your resources if need be.</p>
<P><B>Penalties:</B> <BR>1st offense&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; 0 on the 
assignment or test <BR>2nd offense&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; F grade for the course
<H2><U>Accessibility Statement for Students with Disabilities:</U></H2>
<p>Juniata  College is committed to providing equitable access for learning opportunities  to students. Your experience in this course is important to me, and I am  dedicated to removing barriers and creating a more accessible classroom  environment.<br><br>
  If  you are affiliated with the Student Accessibility Office and have been  determined eligible to receive accommodations, I encourage you to confirm that  I have received a copy of your accommodation letter and schedule a time for us  to meet to discuss your needs in this course. Although it is preferable to  request before the semester begins, requests can be made at any time, but are  not retroactive. <br><br>
Any student who feels they may need an accommodation based on a  documented medical condition, mental health condition or learning disability  (or suspects they may have one), is encouraged to contact the Director  of Student Accessibility Services. There office is located in Founders Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<H2><u>Names and Pronouns:</u></H2>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Many people use a name in daily life that is different from their  legal name. In this classroom, we seek to use people&rsquo;s preferred names and pronouns. You are  invited (if you want to) to share the name and  the pronouns you go by.&nbsp; In this classroom, we will respect and refer to people using the names and personal pronouns that they share.</p>
