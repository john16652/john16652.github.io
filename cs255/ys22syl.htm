<h2><a name="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of this course include the following: 
<ul>
  <li>experience learning a programming language &quot;on your own&quot; as is 
    commonly the case in industry. </li>
  <li style="height: 19px">understand the syntax and semantics of the Python language </li>
  <li>understand how to develop and implement a program in the Python language 
  </li>
  <li>understand various forms of data representation and structures supported 
    by the Python language </li>
  <li>understand the appropriate applications of the Python 
    language </li>
  <li>recognize similarities and common characteristics of programming languages. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The student should develop or enhance skills in the following areas: 
<ul>
  <li>proficient programming in the Python language and programming in general 
  </li>
  <li>design and revision of Python scripts</li>
  <li>debugging techniques appropriate for the Python language </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Structure"></a>Class structure</h2>
<b> 
<p>This is a self paced course with no formally schedule class meetings. Success 
  in this course depends highly on your self discipline. Office hours are to be 
  used to ask questions and clarifications. Individual&nbsp; meetings with the 
  instructor may be required to go over work in progress.</p>
</b> 
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>The reading will consist of chapters from the online ebook and from the 
Python documentation site. Since you should have had programming experiences 
prior to this course and that this material assumes no such background, the reading should be relatively easy.</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>The student is expected to do the reading as specified below prior to 
developing the associated program.&nbsp; There may be a choice of program for each week's 
  assignment. The student is expected to submit the assignment by the due date
  (see exceptions in the assignment descriptions) of each week via Moodle. The 
  &quot;how to submit&quot; is described below.&nbsp; The instructor will review 
  the program by compiling and running the program with his own data set and may reply 
  with suggestions for improvements.&nbsp; If warranted, the assignment may be revised and resubmitted.&nbsp; 
See grading below.</p>
<p>Comments and suggestions regarding each assignment will be provided on each 
  submission.&nbsp; It will be your responsibility to review the comments and 
  possibly make the corrections suggested for resubmission.</p>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>Being a self-paced course, some concepts may not be easily grasped from the 
readings. The instructor is available during office hours for individual help on 
these matters. Please use the office hours for clarification. Be sure that you 
have identified at least one office hour per week that you can regularly come 
for questions and have programs reviewed. We may be able to do most of the 
discussion and program review by email. E-mail is also an ideal and preferred 
communication medium for short questions or clarifications.</p>

<h2><a name="Grading"></a>Grading</h2>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
A variant of the &quot;portfolio method&quot;, analogous to the writing portfolios used in 
College Writing Seminar, will be used in this course. Students are required to 
submit programs to the instructor on a regular basis for review and critique 
according to the syllabus.&nbsp;The instructor will review your programs 
electronically with written critiques through Moodle. It is your responsibility 
to understand the critiques and either resubmit the project or apply the 
comments to future projects.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
The first submission of each completed and documented program must be received 
by the instructor no later than<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;due date 
specified in Moodle</span>. They must compile cleanly and be a viable solution 
to the problem. Programs may then be revised to include the suggestions given 
from the review and resubmitted.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
There are 100 points in total for course assignments. Most projects are worth 10 
points. A few at the beginning of the course are worth less. If the submission 
is acceptable you get all the points for the project. If it is late, then there 
will be points deducted. If the project has problems, it will be given a fairly 
low grade (e.g., 3 or 4 out of 10) but you will be given another week from the 
review to resubmit for full credit. On the second review, the project may 
receive a quality score of 10 or less, but no chance for a third submission.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
There is a 1 point deduction from the final grade for each day late per program. 
If the program does not compile, nor is appropriately documented, nor is a 
reasonable solution to the problem, the program will be rejected as a 
submission, and the late penalty could apply. This is to discourage junk being 
sent in to stop the clock.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
Python Portfolio Grading</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
The final grade will be assigned based on the completeness, quality of the final 
programs in the portfolio, demonstrated improvement in programming skills over 
the course, timeliness of program submissions, attendance to the requested 
individual office meetings, and the reflection paper.</p>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;">
At the end of the course you must write a 2-3 page reflection paper describing 
what you learned about Python and the process of learning a language on your 
own.</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"> All materials for the course, submissions of programs and reflection paper, and all due dates are in Moodle.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Policies"></a> <a href="../policies.htm">Course policies</a> </h2>
<p>These standard course policies are described on this web page. Please read 
  them carefully, especially on academic integrity. Exceptions to my standard 
  policies are given below. </p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Does not apply, but you must submit the programs on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Late program policy</h3>
<p>Late first submissions will have a negative effect on your final grade. Typically 
  1% per school day late is deducted from your final grade. So a program 10 school 
  days (2 weeks) late could reduce the final grade by a whole letter grade. However, 
  extensions may be given in warranted situations that are agreed upon at least 
  one day prior to the due date by instructor and student. </p>
<p><b>Please note that a program submitted which</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>does not compile,</b></li>
  <li><b> is not a viable solution to the problem, or</b></li>
  <li><b>is not documented</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>will be rejected as a submission and therefore considered late.&nbsp;</b> 
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Submission"></a>Program submission details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop, implement and test each program. </li>
  <li>Be sure each program is well documented, with good choice of variable names 
    and use of standard Python style. </li>
  <li>Submit   the documented source file of the program (do not send the 
    object or executable files) using Moodle.</li>
  <li>See the instructor for any clarification prior to submission. </li>
  <li>We will use Moodle  to keep track of the progress 
    and comments for all assignments.</li>
  <li>If the review comments are minor, they will simply be posted in Moodle. If more substantial discussion of a program 
    is necessary, an office meeting will be called.</li>
  <li>Read the comments carefully and if a revision is explicitly requested, you 
    must resubmit the revision within a week of the review, again using Moodle.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Readings"></a>Tentative reading and assignment schedule </h2>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Caution! Many students in the past have lamented that 
  they skipped the reading and simply started the exercises and found they had 
  to spend more time overall to complete them. Discipline yourself to read the 
  material carefully before starting the exercise for the chapter.&nbsp; Start 
  early each week to give yourself time to work through difficult concepts.</font></p>
